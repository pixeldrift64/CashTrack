## About CashTrack

Cashtrack is a work in progress for a simple money management app. The idea is to provide a simple dashboard for users to add their recent transactions manually, which forces the user to see the transactions and think about what they're spending, and then provides some insights on their spending and ways to help them budget.

A lot of money management apps integrate with banks and import transactions automatically, which means the user never has to actually look at the things they are spending money on and forget about it. Cashtrack aims to provide a manual means of tracking money, but then the data analysis at the end of that process.
